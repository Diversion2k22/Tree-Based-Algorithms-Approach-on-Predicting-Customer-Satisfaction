# Tree-Based Algorithms Approach on Predicting Customer Satisfaction

Tree-Based Model Brief Explanation
Decision trees are one of the supervised machine learning methods for classification and regression. In this hands-on project, we will concentrate on the decision tree classifier and its various types, which will provide us with a readable classification model. The tree node on the decision tree classifier represents an attribute test. The branches emerge from that node, with each branch representing one of the previous attribute’s possible values. The leaf grows from those branches, with each leaf corresponding to the class labels associated with the instance. The instances in the training set are directed from the decision tree’s root to the leaf.
